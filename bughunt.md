# Bughunt Notes

This document transcribes the handwritten notes from the front-end bughunt conducted on November 15, 2025 so that the issues can be triaged inside the backlog.

## Raw Transcription

~~- Replicate call webhook when done?~~
~~- Sending requests fails with 404 (request to `/api/v1/generations`).~~
~~- Logo uploads fail 404 at `api/v1/assets/upload`.~~
~~- Parallelize generations.~~
~~- Front end looks like ass, make it pretty.~~
~~- Check gun ads.~~
~~- Previous draft checker needs more helpful messages on buttons.~~
~~- Arbitrary char limit needs to go away.~~
~~- Check default generation time (forced by front-end, disregard).~~
~~- Save generations to S3 and call other modules to handle generations.~~
~~- History button gives JS but not HTTP errors.~~
