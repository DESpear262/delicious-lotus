## Understanding Prompts

### What is a Prompt?

A prompt is your written description of the video you want to create. Think of it as creative direction you'd give to a video production team, explaining:
- **What** the video should show
- **How** it should look and feel
- **Why** you're creating it (purpose and audience)
- **Where** and **when** scenes should take place

### How AI Interprets Your Prompt

The AI analyzes your prompt to:
1. **Extract key concepts**: Identifies main subjects, actions, and settings
2. **Understand style**: Determines visual aesthetic from descriptive words
3. **Plan pacing**: Figures out video flow and timing
4. **Select visuals**: Chooses or generates appropriate imagery
5. **Apply branding**: Incorporates your brand assets and colors

**Key insight**: The AI is very good at following clear, specific instructions, but struggles with vague or contradictory directions.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not Technical

**❌ Bad**: "Shot on cinema camera with shallow depth of field"
**✅ Good**: "Close-up product shots with blurred backgrounds for professional feel"

**Why**: Describe the visual result you want, not the equipment or technical process.

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell

**❌ Bad**: "This is an exciting product"
**✅ Good**: "Dynamic camera movements showcasing product features with energetic music and bold color transitions"

**Why**: Describe what creates excitement rather than just stating it.

### 3. Balance Detail with Freedom

**❌ Too Vague**: "Nice video about our product"
**❌ Too Restrictive**: "Exactly 5 seconds of product rotating clockwise at 15 degrees per second, then 3 seconds of blue background, then..."
**✅ Just Right**: "Product showcase with smooth rotating views, transitioning between solid color backgrounds that match our brand palette"

### 4. Think in Scenes

Structure your prompt as a sequence of scenes or moments:
- Opening/hook (first 3-5 seconds)
- Main content (middle section)
- Call-to-action (final 3-5 seconds)

### 5. Define Your Audience

Mention who the video is for:
- "Target young professionals aged 25-35"
- "Appeal to health-conscious consumers"
- "Designed for B2B decision makers"

This helps the AI choose appropriate tone, pacing, and style.

## Brand Identity in Prompts

### Incorporating Brand Personality

Your brand has a personality. Express it:

**Premium/Luxury Brand**:

deliberate camera movements suggesting quality and exclusivity. Soft, dramatic
lighting. Minimal text, maximum visual impact."

"Sleek, modern, forward-thinking. Clean lines and contemporary design. Use of
motion graphics and digital elements. Futuristic without being cold. Show
technology enhancing human experience."

### Using Brand Colors Effectively

**Be specific about color usage**:
- ❌ "Use blue"
- ✅ "Use our signature sapphire blue (#0047AB) for backgrounds and overlays,
accented with metallic gold (#FFD700)"

**Describe color mood**:
- "Warm, inviting reds and oranges"
- "Cool, professional blues and grays"
- "Natural earth tones - terracotta, sage, cream"
- "Bold, energetic neon colors"

### Logo and Branding Elements

**Specify logo placement**:
- "Display logo prominently in final 5 seconds"
- "Subtle logo watermark in bottom corner throughout"
- "Logo animation as opening sequence"
- "Product packaging showing logo clearly"

**Brand consistency**:
- "Maintain our minimalist design language throughout"
- "Use our signature curved transitions between scenes"
- "Typography should match our brand guidelines - clean sans-serif"

---

## Visual Consistency Tips

### 1. Define a Clear Visual Theme

Choose one cohesive aesthetic:
- Modern minimalist
- Vintage/retro
- Documentary/authentic
- High-energy/dynamic
- Elegant/sophisticated
- Playful/whimsical

### 2. Maintain Consistent Lighting

**Specify lighting mood**:
- "Natural daylight throughout"
- "Warm, golden hour lighting"
- "Dramatic, moody shadows"
- "Bright, even studio lighting"
- "Neon-lit urban night scenes"

### 3. Establish Pacing Early

**Match pace to purpose**:
- Product showcase: Slow, deliberate
- Social media ad: Fast, punchy
- Brand story: Medium, flowing
- Tutorial: Clear, methodical
- Hype/announcement: Energetic, building

### 4. Use Consistent Camera Angles

**Examples**:
- "Eye-level, straight-on shots for authenticity"
- "Slightly elevated angles for product superiority"
- "Low angles for power and confidence"
- "Mix of close-ups and wide shots for variety while maintaining style"

### 5. Repeat Visual Motifs

**Create visual callbacks**:
- "Begin and end with same location from different perspective"
- "Recurring color accent appearing in each scene"
- "Geometric shapes (circles/triangles) as transition elements"
- "Consistent use of split-screen or specific overlay style"

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Being Too Vague

**Bad**: "Make a nice video about our product"

**Why it fails**: AI has no direction on style, content, or purpose

**Fix**: "Create a 30-second energetic product showcase highlighting our
smartphone's camera features through stunning example photos and videos
captured by real users"

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Conflicting Instructions

**Bad**: "Create a calm, relaxing video with fast-paced action and explosive
energy"

**Why it fails**: Contradictory directions confuse the AI

**Fix**: Choose one clear direction. If you want variety, structure it: "Begin
with calm, meditative yoga poses, building gradually to energetic peak
performance moments"

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overly Technical Language

**Bad**: "Shoot on RED camera with 24mm lens at f/2.8, 120fps for slow-motion
B-roll with specific LUT applied in post"

**Why it fails**: AI generates visuals, not literal camera work

**Fix**: "Professional cinematic quality with smooth slow-motion effects and
rich, film-like color grading"

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Listing Instead of Describing

**Bad**: "Show: product, people, office, computer, success, growth, teamwork,
innovation"

**Why it fails**: No context, relationship, or narrative

**Fix**: "Show innovative team collaborating in modern office, using our
software on computers to achieve breakthrough results, celebrating successful
project completion together"

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Forgetting the Audience

**Bad**: Focus only on product features without context

**Why it fails**: Video lacks emotional connection

**Fix**: "Target busy parents who struggle with meal planning. Show them
finding relief and joy using our app to simplify their lives"

---

### ❌ Mistake 6: No Clear Structure

**Bad**: Stream of consciousness with no beginning, middle, or end

**Why it fails**: Creates confusing, aimless video

**Fix**: "Open with problem, transition to solution, demonstrate benefits,
close with call-to-action"

---

### ❌ Mistake 7: Ignoring Duration

**Bad**: Describing 2 minutes of content for a 30-second video

**Why it fails**: Too much content = rushed, ineffective video

**Fix**: Plan realistically: 30 seconds = 1-2 key scenes max, not entire brand
story

---

### ❌ Mistake 8: Passive Language

**Bad**: "There should be some people doing things with the product"

**Why it fails**: Weak, vague direction

**Fix**: "Show enthusiastic customers actively using our product in their daily
routines - morning coffee ritual, commute, work tasks"

---

### ❌ Mistake 9: No Emotional Direction

**Bad**: Only describing what appears, not how it should feel

**Why it fails**: Lacks emotional impact

**Fix**: "Evoke feelings of confidence and empowerment. Viewers should feel
inspired to take action"

---

### ❌ Mistake 10: Forgetting Call-to-Action

**Bad**: Video ends abruptly with no next step

**Why it fails**: Viewers don't know what to do next

**Fix**: "End with clear call-to-action: 'Download Free Today' with app store
buttons visible"

---

## Character Limit Guidelines

### The Character Range: 500-2000

**Why minimums and maximums**:
- **Below 500 chars**: Usually too vague for quality results
- **500-800 chars**: Good for simple, focused videos
- **800-1200 chars**: Sweet spot for most projects
- **1200-2000 chars**: Complex videos needing detailed direction
- **Above 2000 chars**: Often includes unnecessary details that confuse

### Making Every Character Count

**Be concise but descriptive**:
- ❌ "We want to create a video that shows our product in a really good light
and makes people want to buy it"
- ✅ "Product showcase highlighting key features that drive purchase decisions"

**Use strong verbs**:
- ❌ "There are people who are using the product"
- ✅ "Customers enthusiastically demonstrating product features"

**Combine related ideas**:
- ❌ "Show the city. Show the streets. Show urban environments. Show buildings."
- ✅ "Urban cityscape with streets and modern architecture"

### Checking Your Length

Most text editors show character count. Aim for:
- **Minimum viable**: 500 characters (75-100 words)
- **Ideal range**: 800-1200 characters (120-180 words)
- **Maximum allowed**: 2000 characters (300-350 words)

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

For longer videos (45-60 seconds), structure in clear scenes:

```
Scene 1 (0-5 sec): [Opening hook]
Scene 2 (5-15 sec): [Problem or context]
Scene 3 (15-35 sec): [Solution or main content]
Scene 4 (35-50 sec): [Benefits or results]
Scene 5 (50-60 sec): [Call-to-action]
```

### Technique 2: Emotional Arc

Build emotional journey:
- Start: Curiosity or concern
- Middle: Hope and possibility
- End: Satisfaction and motivation

### Technique 3: Visual Metaphors

Use metaphors to communicate abstract concepts:
- Growth = plants sprouting, buildings rising
- Connection = puzzle pieces joining, hands linking
- Speed = time-lapse, fast motion
- Transformation = before/after, metamorphosis

### Technique 4: Contrast and Comparison

Before/after, problem/solution, old/new:
- "Split screen comparing traditional method (slow, complicated) with our
solution (fast, simple)"

### Technique 5: Sensory Language

Engage multiple senses in description:
- Visual: "Vibrant colors, soft focus, dynamic movement"
- Auditory: "Upbeat background music, satisfying click sounds"
- Tactile: "Smooth surfaces, soft fabrics, sturdy construction"
- Emotional: "Feelings of confidence, joy, relief"

### Technique 6: Reference Existing Styles

Use cultural touchpoints (carefully):
- "Documentary-style like nature films"
- "Fast-paced like music videos"
- "Intimate like behind-the-scenes footage"
- "Polished like broadcast commercials"

**Note**: Avoid referencing specific copyrighted works
