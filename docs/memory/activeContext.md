## Recent Decisions

1. **Deployment Strategy** (2025-11-14)
   - Chose Option B: FastAPI serves static files
   - Single container deployment
   - Simpler than Vercel but unified

2. **Work Approach** (2025-11-14)
   - Parallel tracks: DevOps + Frontend simultaneously
   - Credentials provided as needed
   - Focus on immediately unblocked PRs first

3. **Conflict Management** (2025-11-14)
   - One PR = one commit
   - One planning session = one commit
   - Follow commit-policy.md strictly

---

## Current Questions & Blockers

### Resolved
- ✅ Which deployment approach? → Option B
- ✅ When do we get credentials? → As needed
- ✅ Work priority? → Parallel tracks

### Open
- None currently
