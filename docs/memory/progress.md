## What's Working

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Local development environment (Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- ✅ Production-ready database schema (9 tables, views, triggers, helpers)
- ✅ Environment configuration templates (60+ variables for FastAPI, AI service configs)

### Frontend
- ✅ React 19 + Vite + TypeScript project initialized
- ✅ Build system configured (outputs to dist/ for backend serving)
- ✅ Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- ✅ CSS Variables foundation with complete design system
- ✅ Folder structure ready for development
- ✅ Core UI components (Button, Input, Card, Spinner, Toast) - 17 files, 2,436 lines
- ✅ Responsive framework (mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints)
- ✅ Animation system (fade, slide, spin)
- ✅ **Cyberpunk theme fully implemented** - Dark backgrounds with neon accents, glassmorphism effects, scanline patterns, holographic animations
- ✅ Typography updated with Inter, Orbitron, and JetBrains Mono fonts
- ✅ Prompt validation updated - removed 500-character minimum, only 2000-character maximum enforced
- ✅ **ConfirmDialog component** - Custom modal dialog replacing browser confirm with "Resume" and "Discard" buttons for better UX
- ✅ **Replicate video generation centralized** - Extracted working logic from cli.py into reusable generate_video_clips function in ffmpeg-backend
- ✅ **Parallelization support** - Added option to generate video clips concurrently (faster) or sequentially (more coherent). UI switch in ReviewStep with clear messaging about tradeoffs
- ✅ **Switch UI component** - New toggle switch component with cyberpunk theme styling
- ✅ **StorageService** - Environment-aware storage service supporting both S3 (production) and local filesystem (development). Handles file uploads, presigned URLs, and automatic backend switching
- ✅ **GenerationStorageService** - PostgreSQL-based storage for generation metadata with connection pooling, CRUD operations, and pagination support
- ✅ **S3 video storage** - Videos from Replicate are automatically uploaded to S3/local storage after generation, stored at `generations/{generation_id}/clips/{clip_id}.mp4`
- ✅ **Database persistence** - Generation metadata stored in PostgreSQL with JSONB fields for flexible metadata storage
- ✅ **GET /api/v1/generations endpoint** - List generations with pagination, status filtering, and proper error handling
- ✅ **History page null safety** - Fixed TypeError by adding defensive checks for undefined/empty generations arrays

### Backend/AI

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (20/21 tests passing, 95.2% success rate)
- ✅ API contracts validated for frontend and FFmpeg integration
- ✅ End-to-end prompt → analysis → scene planning → clip generation → editing pipeline working
- ✅ **Real MP4 video generation from Replicate API** (downloads actual 25MB+ video files)
- ✅ Brand consistency engine with accessibility compliance and visual coherence
- ✅ AI video generation orchestration with Wan-video/wan-2.2-t2v-fast integration
- ✅ Natural language video editing with safety guardrails and conflict resolution

---

## Risk Register

### High Risk
1. **48-hour MVP deadline** - Very tight timeline
   - Mitigation: Parallel work streams, focus on core features only

2. **Backend team dependency** - PR-D002 blocked
   - Mitigation: Backend team actively working, we proceed with unblocked work

3. **AWS credentials timing** - Multiple tasks need credentials
   - Mitigation: User provides as needed, documentation work proceeds in parallel

### Medium Risk
1. **Multiple agents coordination** - Potential for conflicts
   - Mitigation: Strict file locking, commit policy adherence

2. **Integration complexity** - 4 separate tracks must integrate
   - Mitigation: Clear API contracts, early integration testing

### Low Risk
1. **Cost overruns** - Replicate API costs
   - Mitigation: Use cheaper models, smart caching, lifecycle policies
