## General Questions

### What is the AI Video Generation Platform?

Our platform uses artificial intelligence to automatically create professional video content based on your text descriptions. You provide a written prompt describing your desired video, upload your brand assets, and our AI handles the entire video production process - from planning and visual generation to editing and final rendering.

### What types of videos can I create?

Currently in MVP:
- **Ad Creative videos**: 15-60 second promotional videos perfect for advertising campaigns, social media, and marketing

Coming soon:
- **Music Video pipeline**: 60-180 second videos synchronized to music or audio tracks

### Do I need any video editing experience?

No! That's the beauty of our platform. You don't need any video editing skills, technical knowledge, or expensive software. If you can describe what you want in writing, our AI can create it.

### How much does it cost?

*[Pricing information to be added based on business model]*

Currently in development phase. Contact us for early access and pricing information.

## Generation Process

### How long does video generation take?

**Typical generation time**: 4-12 minutes

Factors that affect speed:
- **Video duration**: Longer videos take more time
- **Prompt complexity**: More detailed descriptions require more processing
- **Server load**: During peak times, generation may take longer
- **Brand assets**: Number and size of uploaded files

**Breakdown by stage:**
- Input validation: 5-10 seconds
- Content planning: 20-30 seconds
- Asset generation: 2-8 minutes (largest portion)
- Video composition: 1-3 minutes
- Final rendering: 30-60 seconds

### What happens during generation?

Our AI goes through several stages:

1. **Analyzes your prompt** to understand what you want
2. **Plans the video** shot-by-shot with pacing and transitions
3. **Generates visual content** using AI image and video generation
4. **Incorporates your brand assets** (logo, images, colors)
5. **Assembles clips** with transitions, effects, and timing
6. **Renders final video** in your selected format and aspect ratio

You can watch progress in real-time with our progress tracker.

### Can I cancel a generation in progress?

Yes! If you change your mind or spot a mistake:

1. Click the "Cancel Generation" button
2. Confirm cancellation in the popup
3. Generation will stop immediately
4. You'll return to the form to make changes

**Important notes:**
- Cancellation is permanent - you cannot resume
- No charges for canceled generations
- You'll need to submit a new request to try again

### Can I edit or modify a video after it's generated?

Currently, videos cannot be edited after generation. If you need changes:

1. Submit a new generation request with updated parameters
2. Modify your prompt to describe desired changes
3. Adjust brand assets or video settings as needed

**Tip**: Review all settings carefully before submitting to avoid regeneration.

### Can I save my settings and generate multiple videos?

While we don't currently have a "save template" feature, you can:
- Keep your prompt in a text file for reuse
- Upload the same brand assets multiple times
- Use the same settings with different prompts

**Coming soon**: Template saving and batch generation features.

## Troubleshooting

### What if my video generation fails?

**Common causes and solutions:**

**1. Invalid prompt content**
- Review prompt for prohibited content
- Ensure prompt meets minimum character count (500)
- Simplify overly complex prompts

**2. Upload issues**
- Verify all files uploaded successfully
- Check file formats and sizes
- Re-upload brand assets if needed

**3. Server errors**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check if platform is under maintenance
- Contact support if persistent

**4. Network interruption**
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Avoid switching networks during generation
- Try from a different location if connection is unstable

### The generated video doesn't match my prompt. Why?

**Common reasons:**

**1. Prompt is too vague**
- Add more specific details
- Describe visual elements clearly
- Specify mood, pacing, and style

**2. Conflicting instructions**
- Review prompt for contradictions
- Simplify complex requests
- Focus on core message

**3. Unrealistic expectations**
- AI has creative limitations
- Some concepts are harder to visualize
- Very niche references may not translate well

**4. Random variation**
- Each generation is unique
- Try generating again for different result
- AI makes creative choices within your parameters

**Solution**: Read our [Prompt Best Practices](./prompt-best-practices.md) guide and refine your prompt.

### My brand logo isn't appearing in the video

**Check these items:**

1. **Upload confirmed**: Verify file uploaded successfully
2. **File format**: Use PNG with transparent background for logos
3. **File quality**: Ensure logo is high resolution and clear
4. **Mention in prompt**: Reference your brand/logo in the prompt
5. **AI decisions**: Sometimes logo placement is minimal or subtle

**Tip**: Explicitly mention "prominently display our brand logo" in your prompt.

### Video playback is choppy or buffering

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for full load**: Allow video to buffer completely
2. **Check connection**: Ensure stable, fast internet
3. **Download instead**: Play downloaded file locally
4. **Update browser**: Use latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
5. **Close other tabs**: Free up browser resources
6. **Disable extensions**: Some extensions interfere with video playback

### I can't download my video

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Check browser permissions**: Allow downloads from our site
2. **Disable popup blocker**: May prevent download
3. **Clear download folder**: Ensure disk space available
4. **Try different browser**: Rule out browser-specific issues
5. **Right-click and "Save As"**: Alternative download method

## Prompts and Quality

### How do I write better prompts?

Great question! Key principles:

**1. Be specific but not restrictive**
- ✅ "Modern tech startup with energetic young team collaborating"
- ❌ "Office" (too vague)
- ❌ "Shot on RED camera with 24mm lens at f/2.8" (too technical)

**2. Describe the feeling and mood**
- Include adjectives: "energetic", "calm", "professional", "playful"
- Mention lighting: "warm sunset", "bright daylight", "moody shadows"

**3. Define your audience and purpose**
- "Target young professionals aged 25-35"
- "Promote new product launch"
- "Build brand awareness"

**4. Include call-to-action**
- What do you want viewers to do?
- What's your key message?

**5. Reference your brand**
- Mention brand colors
- Reference brand personality
- Describe your products/services

**Read more**: [Prompt Best Practices Guide](./prompt-best-practices.md)

### What's the ideal prompt length?

**Character limits:**
- Minimum: 500 characters (about 75-100 words)
- Maximum: 2000 characters (about 300-350 words)
- Sweet spot: 800-1200 characters (detailed but focused)

**Why these limits?**
- Too short: Not enough detail for AI to work with
- Too long: May include conflicting or unnecessary information
- Just right: Enough detail with clear direction

### Can I include brand names and trademarked terms?

**Your own brand:** ✅ Yes!
- Include your company name
- Reference your trademarked products
- Mention your slogans and taglines

**Other brands:** ⚠️ Be cautious
- Avoid unauthorized use of competitor brands
- Don't reference trademarked characters or franchises
- Generic terms are fine ("smartphone", "car", "coffee")

### What content is prohibited?

We prohibit generation of:
- ❌ Violent or graphic content
- ❌ Adult or sexual content
- ❌ Hate speech or discriminatory content
- ❌ Misleading health or financial claims
- ❌ Copyright infringing material
- ❌ Illegal activities or products

Violations may result in generation failure or account suspension.
