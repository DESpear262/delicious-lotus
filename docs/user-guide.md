## Creating Your First Ad Creative Video

### Step 1: Describe Your Video

The most important part of creating a great video is writing a clear, detailed description (called a "prompt"). Think of this as giving creative direction to a video production team.

**What to include in your prompt:**
- The main message or story you want to tell
- The mood or feeling (energetic, calm, professional, playful)
- Key visual elements (colors, settings, objects)
- Your target audience
- The call-to-action (what you want viewers to do)

**Example prompts:**
```
"Create an energetic 30-second ad for our new running shoes. Show dynamic shots
of athletes training in urban environments at sunrise. Use bold colors and
fast-paced transitions. Target audience: young professionals aged 25-35.
End with our logo and tagline 'Run Your World.'"
```

```
"Professional product showcase for luxury skincare line. Elegant, minimalist
aesthetic with soft lighting. Show product bottles with smooth camera movements,
close-ups of ingredients, and happy customers with glowing skin. Use calming
music and premium feel. Call-to-action: 'Discover Your Glow.'"
```

**Prompt guidelines:**
- **Minimum**: 500 characters
- **Maximum**: 2000 characters
- Be specific but not overly restrictive
- Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than technical details

💡 **Tip**: Check out our [Prompt Best Practices](./prompt-best-practices.md) guide for more detailed tips and examples.

The AI will incorporate these colors into the generated visuals and backgrounds.

## Understanding the Generation Process

After you submit your request, our AI gets to work creating your video. Here's what happens:

### Generation Stages

**1. Input Validation** (5-10 seconds)
- System checks your prompt and settings
- Validates uploaded files
- Confirms all requirements are met

**2. Content Planning** (20-30 seconds)
- AI analyzes your prompt
- Creates a shot-by-shot plan
- Determines visual style and pacing

**3. Asset Generation** (2-8 minutes)
- AI generates individual video clips
- Creates visual elements based on your prompt
- Incorporates your brand assets and colors
- Progress shows as "X/Y clips completed"

**4. Video Composition** (1-3 minutes)
- Assembles all clips into final video
- Adds transitions and effects
- Applies color grading
- Renders final output

**5. Final Rendering** (30-60 seconds)
- Encodes video to MP4 format
- Optimizes for quality and file size
- Prepares for download

### Total Time

Typical generation time: **4-12 minutes**

Factors that affect speed:
- Video duration (longer = more time)
- Complexity of prompt
- Number of brand assets
- Current server load

### Progress Tracking

3. You'll return to the form to make changes

**Note**: You cannot resume a canceled job. You'll need to submit a new request.

**Preparation:**
- Use PNG format with transparent background for best results
- Ensure logo is high resolution (at least 1000px wide)

- May appear as a watermark during certain scenes
- Always positioned professionally according to composition rules

### Product Images

**What works best:**
- Clean, professional product photography
- White or simple backgrounds
- Multiple angles of the same product
- Context shots (product in use)

**What to avoid:**
- Blurry or low-resolution images
- Images with heavy text overlays
- Screenshots or images from websites
- Images with watermarks

### Brand Colors

**Choosing colors:**
- Use your official brand colors from your brand guidelines
- Select 2-3 primary colors
- The AI will use these for backgrounds, overlays, and accents

**Color application:**
- Colors appear in backgrounds and transitions
- Used for text overlays and graphics
- Applied to lighting and mood
- Complemented with neutral tones for balance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Generation Failed

**Problem**: Video generation stopped with an error

**Common causes:**
- Server overload or temporary outage

**Solutions:**
1. Check error message for specific details
2. Verify all uploaded files are valid and not corrupted
3. Review your prompt for clarity and appropriateness
4. Try submitting again after a few minutes
5. If problem persists, contact support

### Upload Failed

**Problem**: Cannot upload logo or product images

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file size**: Must be under 50MB
2. **Verify format**: Only JPEG and PNG are supported
3. **Test your connection**: Ensure stable internet
4. **Try a different file**: Current file may be corrupted
5. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes helps with upload issues
6. **Use a different browser**: Rule out browser-specific issues

### Video Won't Play

**Problem**: Generated video won't play in preview

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page**: Simple but often effective
2. **Check browser**: Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
3. **Update browser**: Ensure you have the latest version
4. **Disable extensions**: Ad blockers may interfere
5. **Download instead**: Try playing downloaded file locally

### Slow Generation

**Problem**: Video taking longer than expected

**Causes:**
- High server load (many users generating simultaneously)
- Complex prompts requiring more processing
- Longer duration videos
- Large number of brand assets

**What to do:**
- Be patient - quality takes time!
- Avoid refreshing the page (won't speed things up)
- If stuck for more than 20 minutes, try canceling and resubmitting
- Consider simplifying your prompt or reducing duration

### Wrong Aspect Ratio

**Problem**: Generated video doesn't match selected aspect ratio

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check aspect ratio selection before submitting
2. If wrong aspect ratio was used, generate a new video
3. Cannot change aspect ratio after generation starts
4. Download and crop using video editing software (not ideal)

### Poor Quality Results

**Problem**: Generated video doesn't match expectations

**Common issues:**
- Prompt too vague or generic
- Conflicting instructions in prompt
- Low-quality uploaded assets
- Unrealistic expectations

**Improvements:**
1. **Refine your prompt**: Be more specific and detailed
2. **Use better assets**: Upload higher resolution images
3. **Study examples**: Look at prompt best practices
4. **Try again**: Each generation is unique
5. **Simplify**: Sometimes less is more

### Brand Assets Not Appearing

**Problem**: Uploaded logo or images not visible in video

**Possible reasons:**

- Format incompatibility
- Prompt didn't mention brand assets
- AI creative decisions

**What to do:**
