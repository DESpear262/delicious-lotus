		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Media Library Backend API",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Database schema design and migrations for MediaAsset model, 2) File upload API with multipart support and S3 integration, 3) CRUD REST endpoints with pagination/filtering/sorting, 4) Folder management system with nested hierarchy, 5) Tagging system with many-to-many relationships, 6) Thumbnail generation service using FFmpeg, 7) WebSocket notifications for real-time updates",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple integrated systems: database design, S3 storage, FFmpeg processing, WebSocket real-time updates, and comprehensive REST API. Requires careful architecture for scalability and performance with bulk operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Create Frontend React Application Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Vite + React + TypeScript project initialization with folder structure, 2) TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui setup with custom theming, 3) Zustand store architecture for state management, 4) React Router and base layout components, 5) API layer with Axios and React Query configuration",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity as it's foundational setup work. While mostly configuration, it requires careful planning of architecture, state management patterns, and component structure that will impact the entire application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Timeline UI Component System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Timeline virtualization with react-window for performance, 2) Track component with drag-to-reorder functionality, 3) Clip component with drag/resize/trim capabilities, 4) Playhead and TimelineRuler with frame-accurate positioning, 5) Zoom controls with logarithmic scaling, 6) Snapping system for precision editing, 7) Multi-selection with marquee and keyboard modifiers, 8) Undo/redo system with temporal state management",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to performance requirements (virtualization), complex user interactions (drag/drop, resize, multi-selection), frame-accurate timing, and state management with undo/redo. This is the core UI component requiring significant optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Build Hybrid Playback Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) PlaybackEngine class with frame-based timing system, 2) Video element management with dynamic source switching, 3) CSS transform system for real-time effects, 4) Text/image overlay renderer with DOM elements, 5) Transition system with CSS animations, 6) Audio synchronization with Web Audio API, 7) Playback controls and performance monitoring",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity requiring deep understanding of video playback, frame-accurate timing, CSS transforms, and performance optimization. The hybrid approach mixing video elements with DOM overlays adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Media Details Panel",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) MediaDetailsPanel component with collapsible property sections, 2) Custom property editors including timecode input component, 3) Real-time preview system with bidirectional sync, 4) Batch editing and preset management",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on form controls and state synchronization. Main challenges are the custom timecode input, real-time preview, and maintaining bidirectional sync with the timeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI Generation Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) AI generation modal UI with prompt and settings, 2) Replicate API service layer integration, 3) Generation queue management with concurrency control, 4) WebSocket progress tracking system, 5) Auto-import to media library and generation history",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to external API integration, concurrent request management, real-time progress tracking via WebSocket, and integration with media library. Existing Replicate implementation provides a foundation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Create Export System UI",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Export modal with multi-step wizard UI, 2) Export settings form with validation and constraints, 3) WebSocket progress tracking with stage visualization, 4) Download management with signed URLs, 5) Export queue and history management",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multi-step wizard, real-time progress tracking, WebSocket integration, and coordination with backend export system. Requires careful state management and error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Thumbnail Cache System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) IndexedDB service for thumbnail storage, 2) LRU cache manager with size-based eviction, 3) Lazy loading service with viewport detection, 4) WebWorker for thumbnail generation, 5) Cache statistics and management UI, 6) Retry logic and progressive loading",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to IndexedDB management, LRU algorithm implementation, WebWorker integration, and performance optimization requirements. Requires careful memory management and async coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Build Mobile-Responsive Layout",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Responsive layout system with TailwindCSS breakpoints, 2) Timeline Lite component for mobile with touch gestures, 3) Mobile-specific UI patterns (bottom sheets, action sheets), 4) Touch-optimized controls and gestures, 5) Mobile asset browser with infinite scroll, 6) Haptic feedback and orientation handling",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need for completely different UI paradigms on mobile, touch gesture implementation, performance optimization for mobile devices, and maintaining feature parity with desktop version."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Auto-Save and Project Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Dirty state tracking with Zustand middleware, 2) Auto-save service with debouncing and background saving, 3) Project serialization and deserialization, 4) Backend project API endpoints, 5) Project management UI with search/filter/sort, 6) Version history and conflict resolution",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to state tracking across entire application, serialization of complex project state, conflict resolution for concurrent edits, and version history management. Critical for data integrity and user experience."
